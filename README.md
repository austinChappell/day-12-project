# Day 12 Assignment

## Project Details

This was a daily assignment frmo The Iron Yard in DOM manipulation.

### Things to know

A for loop is used to iterate through the data. Upon each iteration, a new div is created and given the class 'relative'. Other elements are created or assigned through each iteration.

If the type property is equal to select, a select element is created, and a nested loop is used to create the option elements to correspond to the select element.

Else, if the type equals 'textarea', create a textarea element, else create an input element. All of the created elements (select, textarea, input) are saved as the variable input, and then assigned a type value, a placeholder value, padding, classes, and then appended to the div.
